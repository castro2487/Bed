## Editor support

To make it easier to work with the Salesforce cloud platform you should use
an editor plugin that automatically synchronises file changes and provide
other useful support. Try one of these:

- PHPStorm: [Salesforce B2C Commerce (SFCC)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13668-salesforce-b2c-commerce-sfcc-).
  This is a commercial extension that costs â‚¬70 per year and user. A 30-day 
  trial is available.
- VS Code: [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode).
